## Week 2
### Learning Objectives
- An idea is worth nothing. It's all in the execution.
- In software engineering, a programming language is a tool and can be learned very quickly.
- Test Everything (Be curious about the how's and why's).
- Moonshot thinking.
- Software engineering is more about dealing with people than dealing with computers.
- A rock-solid grasp of computer science fundamentals.
- Knowledge of how to learn.

### Module's Requirements
- Weekly Essay published in your blog. It's an open writing style, but you should include your takeaways of the week. Make sure you're answering what did you learned and how you can implement those new learnings in the near future.
- About Programming Assignments: All the programming assignments should have two outputs: "published code" and a "technical log document".

### Assignments
1. Individually, create a new repository called LeetCode in your personal's Encora Github account (Not in the organization, but using your Encora's email).
2. LeetCode As Team, solve the following leet code problems with Python, Java, and TypeScript programming languages:
  - Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III
  - Patching Array
  - Department Top Three Salaries (SQL)
  - Shortest Palindrome
  - Each team should create one Pull Request in their LeetCode repository for each Programming Language. Put each problem in a different file in the same PR. Example:
    - JavaScript (folder)
      - Problem1.js
      - Problem2.js
      - Problem3.js
      - Problem4.js
  - Each team should have at least 3 people.

3. Problem Solving Leet Code as Individual Contributor: Choose one of the following problems and solve it using the programming language that you feel most comfortable with. Create a PR in your Github (encora's email) with the solution.
  - Permutations
  - Convert an Array Into a 2D Array with Conditions

4. Your blog: Create a public blog, where you'll keep the record of your learning path during the Spark. (You can use Github Pages, Medium, etc) but you've to keep in mind that a good design and presentation is required because we will share those links with clients later.
  - Create your first technical log docs about Leet Code contributions. (Keep your individual contribution separated)
  - Let us know when you've submitted your solutions by email. Include the repository link to the code, technical log docs (link or whatever we need to review it) and what exercise and language you chose in your individual assignment.
  - Weekly Essay publish it in your blog, and share when it's done by email: spark2024d-mx@encora.com
